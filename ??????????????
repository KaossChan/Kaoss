<p> The world was once an open book, A realm of knowledge and truth. Where stories were spun with a magical look, Tales of wisdom and youth. The pages were filled with characters bold, A rainbow of cultures and races. The heroes and villains of ages untold, Each with their own special places. The words and the worlds that they formed, Were crafted with beauty and grace. The tales and the stories were transformed, Into a beautiful tapestry of lace. The poems and songs of the ancients, Still stir the heart to this day. The masterful words and their sentiments, Form an emotional bouquet. The stories of love and of loss, The tragedies and the joys, The characters that we follow across, Through the pages of these ancient tomes. The stories will never be forgotten, Our memories always remain. The literature of ages past, Will live on in our hearts and brains. Once upon a star-strewn night I had a dream of wondrous sight I beheld a beautiful world Filled with secrets yet to be unfurled The sky was a deep violet hue and the stars, they seemed to whisper to me too I had a feeling of peace and content As I walked through the grass unspent The wind was cool and gentle, like a friend Bringing with it a story to lend A tale of beauty, of love, of loss Of a journey that could cost or not The trees moved in a graceful dance Bidding me to take a chance To explore the unknown and find The secrets it held in its mind I ventured forth, feeling brave Though I had no idea what I'd save I stumbled upon a library old And all of its secrets, it began to unfold It told me stories of the past Of battles that would never last Of kings and queens, princes and maids And all of their glorious parades It spoke of battles and wars lost Of kings and their mighty hosts Of knights who fought for glory and pride And of lovers who never did decide It told me of a world of fantasy Where creatures and dragons roamed free Of magical spells and wondrous things And of a power that no one could bring At last, my journey was at an end And I had found a world to transcend A place of beauty, of dreams, and of lore That I would cherish evermore&nbsp;</p>
